# 🌊 aQuatonomous Website

This is the official website for **aQuatonomous**, a student-led design team building sustainable autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) for environmental research on Lake Ontario. Our mission is to develop clean-powered marine robotics and showcase our work through outreach, competition, and collaboration.

> 🚢 In 2025, aQuatonomous placed 4th in Design Presentation and reached the semi-finals at the RoboNation RoboBoat competition — a strong start to an even stronger future.
