        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
            Founded in 2023, our team has rapidly grown to over 35 passionate members, with a focus on continual expansion and innovation. Our mission centers on constructing and programming a state-of-the-art solar-powered autonomous surface vessel (ASV), providing students with a unique, hands-on opportunity to engage with cutting edge autonomous vehicle technology. We aim to be at the forefront of AI-driven autonomy and sustainable design, integrating the expertise of our diverse sub-teams: mechanical, electrical, perception, ecological & water research, business, and core-autonomy. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
            Our ASV project not only advances autonomous maritime technology but also catalyzes sustainability and ecological restoration efforts. Our team offers the boat to water and environmental researchers as a research vessel and measurement station.  
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
            We encourage students from all disciplines to join us, bringing their unique perspectives and skills to advance autonomous maritime technology. Through collaboration and innovation, we aim to make significant strides interdisciplinary water research and autonomous vehicle design.        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Hands-On Learning and Professional Development</h3>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
          We provide students with valuable hands-on experience in building and programming autonomous vehicles. This includes offering <strong>fieldwork opportunities</strong> to disciplines that traditionally lack such exposure, such as mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
          Through teamwork and practical application, we foster an environment where students from all disciplines can learn and grow professionally. Additionally, we are committed to recruiting first-year students, ensuring they gain early exposure to real-world projects and become integral parts of our team from the start.
