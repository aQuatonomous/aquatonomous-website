        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
            Founded in 2023, our team has rapidly grown to over 100+ passionate members, with a focus on continual expansion and innovation. Our mission centers on constructing and programming a state-of-the-art solar-powered autonomous surface vessel (ASV), providing students with a unique, hands-on opportunity to engage with cutting edge autonomous vehicle technology. We aim to be at the forefront of AI-driven autonomy and sustainable design, integrating the expertise of our diverse sub-teams: mechanical, electrical, perception, ecological & water research, business, and core-autonomy. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
            Our ASV project not only advances autonomous maritime technology but also catalyzes sustainability and ecological restoration efforts. Our team offers the boat to water and environmental researchers as a research vessel and measurement station.  
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
            We encourage students from all disciplines to join us, bringing their unique perspectives and skills to advance autonomous maritime technology. Through collaboration and innovation, we aim to make significant strides interdisciplinary water research and autonomous vehicle design.        </p>

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
          We provide students with valuable hands-on experience in building and programming autonomous vehicles. This includes offering <strong>fieldwork opportunities</strong> to disciplines that traditionally lack such exposure, such as mechanical, computer, and electrical engineering. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-3">
          Through teamwork and practical application, we foster an environment where students from all disciplines can learn and grow professionally. Additionally, we are committed to recruiting first-year students, ensuring they gain early exposure to real-world projects and become integral parts of our team from the start.

            <p class="text-slate-600">
              The mechanical team is responsible for creating a buoyant and stable ASV hull, and designing the propulsion system. The hull must comply with Roboboat competition rules: no more than six feet in length, four feet in width, and no heavier than 75 lbs. They also ensure that all components used by other teams are waterproof, ready for in-water testing.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">
              Additionally, they design a simple transport cart for the hull, often in a quick hackathon session of just three hours!

            <p class="text-slate-600">
              The electrical team focuses on designing an efficient sensor suite while minimizing costs, integrating the payload computer with onboard sensors, and implementing a robust e-stop safety system with both physical and remote access.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">
              They also collaborate with the mechanical team to ensure smooth motor control for propulsion.

            <p class="text-slate-600">
              The autonomy team develops path planning and behavior planning algorithms for the ASV. During the inaugural year, methods like A* for path planning, basic if-else behaviors, and PID control will provide a strong foundation for future advancements.
            </p>

            <p class="text-slate-600">
              The perception team handles localization, mapping, and obstacle detection using the sensor suite. They collaborate closely with the electrical team to determine sensor specifications and placement.
            </p>
            <p class="text-slate-600 mt-4">
              Since the Roboboat competition doesn‚Äôt provide a map, the perception team is fully responsible for creating maps and relaying them to the autonomy team.
